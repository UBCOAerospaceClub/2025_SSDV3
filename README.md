# The Super Step Down V3

![Top View](kicad/SSDV3_board_snazzy.png)

The SSDV3 is an independently-made, non-isolated DC/DC converter designed for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The module is intended for converting 50V battery input down to 5-12V output at a maximum load of 8A. It acts as a reliable battery-eliminator circuit (BEC) through effective regulation in the presence of voltage transients caused by high-power brushless motors.

## Comparison with Last Super Step Down

This design is motivated by the challenges encountered by the [UBCO Aerospace Club](https://github.com/UBCOAerospaceClub) with their Jellyfish quadcopter when powering auxiliary electronics off the drone's main battery. Lessons were learned through a variety of integration failures, investigations, and validation testing, and these experiences informed the development of version 3 of the Super Step Down series.

**Improvements from the previous version:**

- Dramatically improved regulation during line transients
- Considerable footprint area reduction by 16.5%
- Configurable output voltages instead of a fixed 5V output
- Added ESD protection on inputs
- Reverse polarity protection for the majority of the circuit
- Lower losses by using direct wire solder pads instead of terminal block
